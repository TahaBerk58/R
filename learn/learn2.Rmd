# Data Structures

#### Vectors

A vector is simply a list of items that are of the same type.

To combine the list of items to a vector, use the c() function and separate the items by a comma.

In the example below, we create a vector variable called fruits, that combine strings:
```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "peach")

fruits
```
