# Data Structures

#### Vectors

A vector is simply a list of items that are of the same type.

To combine the list of items to a vector, use the `c()` function and separate the items by a comma.

In the example below, we create a vector variable called fruits, that combine strings:
```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "peach")

fruits
```
```{r}
numbers <- 1:10
numbers
```
```{r}
# Vector with numerical decimals in a sequence
numbers1 <- 1.5:6.5
numbers1

# Vector with numerical decimals in a sequence where the last element is not used
numbers2 <- 1.5:6.3
numbers2
```
```{r}
# Vector of logical values
log_values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

log_values
```
#### Vector Length
To find out how many items a vector has, use the `length()` function:
